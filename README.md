### 1. Scientific transliteration tool for Belarusian and Russian

It is one-to-one transliteration of Belarusian and Russian texts by means of the letters of so called Latin (rather Latin-based) alphabeth, which is called romanization. It is required if you prepare a paper for international publication and would like to present Russian or Belarusian examples in romanized form for readability, e.g. if your readers are not specialists in Slavic studies.
